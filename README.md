# Canadian-Computing-Competition-
This is a collection of my solution of [Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html). The solutions are written in Python. And 2020 file has been splitted into sections because I find it helpful to show shorter codes in frequent way.

### DMOJ

[DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?search=CCC) has a mirror of CCC grader's test cases on all CCC problems.

**Python code** It is clearly stated on the CCC official website that the problem is not designed to get full mark on all languages even if an optimal solution is used, that is, for a scripting language like Python, it probably fail on some cases with large dataset.

This case has happened to me on 2020 tests and could not grant full marks. However this should give those who are prepraring for this competition a sense of writing these code and I found Python is a language has the benefit to show the process in a clearer way.
